# Entropy Collapse Cosmology: From Quantum Field to Galactic Structure
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16617259.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16617259)

A new cosmological framework proposing that all structure formation in the universe emerges from entropy expansion potential rather than gravitational attraction.

## Abstract

This paper proposes a revolutionary cosmological framework where structure formation, from subatomic particles to galaxies, emerges from entropy expansion potential — not gravitational attraction. A foundational scalar collapse equation, **a = n² - n_bc**, drives system transitions by comparing available quantum microstates to constrained, structured states. 

The theory derives classical results (Newton's law, Einstein field equations) from entropy gradients, reinterprets black holes as entropy-saturated collapses, and shows that planetary and galactic motion follow entropic equilibrium — not invisible forces. The framework is testable, falsifiable, and consistent with known quantum and thermodynamic principles.

## Key Concepts

### The Foundational Equation
a = n² - n_bc


Where:
- **a**: Entropic imbalance signal
- **n**: Number of available microstates (entropy potential)
- **n_bc**: Number of boundary-constrained microstates

### Core Principles
1. **Structure emerges from entropy imbalance**, not external forces
2. **Mass is not primitive** — it results from entropy collapse
3. **Space (ESC) is carved dynamically** by mass expressing entropy
4. **Gravity is reinterpreted** as entropy-driven spatial expansion
5. **Black holes represent maximum entropy saturation**, not singularities

## Key Results

- ✅ **Exact match** with Landauer's principle for information erasure
- ✅ **Predicts neutron interferometry** phase shifts (Δφ ≈ 2.16 rad)
- ✅ **Explains galactic rotation curves** without dark matter
- ✅ **Derives Newton's law** from entropy gradients
- ✅ **Recovers Einstein field equations** from thermodynamics
- ✅ **Falsifiable prediction**: δa ≲ 2×10⁻¹⁴ m/s² in atom interferometry

## Experimental Validation

The theory makes specific, testable predictions distinguishable from standard physics:
- Entropic corrections to gravitational acceleration at quantum scales
- Planetary atmospheres as entropic phenomena
- Galaxy rotation from entropy-space expansion (ESC)
- Black hole entropy discharge mechanisms
